<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">

<p>NOTE: I wrote a majority of this back in November shortly after the taping but have
gone back and fixed details such as when things happened during the taping after seeing
the finished product on-air. I may have already mentioned some of these things elsewhere,
but I think putting all of them in their own big post would be beneficial. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;A lot of people have had questions about what it&#146;s like being a contestant on
The Price is Right now with all their new COVID protocols. I have had the wonderful
fortune of appearing on one of the most recent The Price is Right at Night specials,
celebrating superfans, and I figured I would take this opportunity to share my experience
from beginning to end. The story isn&#146;t anywhere near as straightforward as it should
have been, but that made it more exciting and unforgettable.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">My story begins on September 8<sup>th</sup>,
2022. The show put out a release stating they were looking for superfans to apply to be on
a special episode of the show. I applied on a whim, not expecting to get chosen at all,
but since I&#146;ve applied for numerous other shows and I&#146;ve already turned down an
internship at my local combined NBC/CBS affiliate to keep my eligibility for a majority of
shows open, I decided that if I didn&#146;t get on anything this semester, that I would
push forward with my career plans and not get the experience of being a contestant. On
September 26<sup>th</sup> I received an email from a casting assistant from Pitman
Casting, the third-party casting agency that has been handling contestant applications
since COVID began, asking for my phone number and if I was available November 9<sup>th</sup>
for taping. I of course agree, even if I&#146;m not quite sure if I could swing the cost
of flying out and back, mainly because when else am I ever going to get this opportunity
again?</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">A few days later on September 28<sup>th</sup>,
I get a phone call from a Chattanooga, TN area phone number. At this point in time,
I&#146;m on vacation with my family in Dollywood, just up in Pigeon Forge so I ignore the
call thinking it&#146;s a local spam call. Except it&#146;s not. It&#146;s another casting
associate with Pitman wanting to talk over a quick phone call and to schedule a Zoom
interview. Once I get a voice mail and text message telling me who called, I immediately
start freaking out trying to figure out a quiet place to make a phone call and if
I&#146;ve just missed my one and only opportunity. A quick game of phone tag leads to me
talking with him in a corner by the fitting rooms in a gift shop called Dolly&#146;s
Closet. Make your own joke about that one. While on the phone I talk briefly with the
casting associate who gives me some tips on the process, sends an email with a brief 2
minute long video on how to make the most out of your audition Zoom call and a bunch of
tips on how to make yourself look good, such as lighting properly, what to wear (business
casual), how you should be over the top excited, making sure your camera is eye level from
you and is horizontal if you&#146;re on a phone, and other good Zoom tips.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">The next morning, I was the last person to
enter the waiting room for my respective interview block, mainly because I was super
anxious about the interview and just keep panicking every time I went to join, so I waited
about an hour and got to watch the end of The Young and The Restless (what can I say, I
like CBS&#146; daytime lineup?) before starting my interview. The interview was rather
easy and a smooth experience. I explained who I am, what I do for a living, since I&#146;m
a student what my major is, and why I consider myself a Price is Right superfan. The
person I was interviewed by gave me a few tips as they could see I was a little nervous
and wanted me to come out of my shell a little bit to bring the big excitement. I was
asked some questions that are known to be some of Stan&#146;s old &#147;tells&#148; such
as what&#146;s your favorite pricing game, and with my answer of Ten Chances (and
explaining why) I took it as a really good sign. By the end of the 2- or 3-minute
interview I was bouncing around, jumping up and down, and overall, fairly confident that I
had a decent shot at it. I was told that the recording of that Zoom call would be edited
down to a 30- to 45-second-long video clip and shown to the casting team for Price and the
network.</span></p>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">

<p>About a week later, on October 6<sup>th</sup>, I received a text from another casting
assistant, this time with the show itself, once again confirming that A: I&#146;m
available to travel out for the tape date, and B: I&#146;m fully vaccinated. After a quick
confirmation, I take a risk. After going through some other casting processes for some
slightly less coordinated shows, I double check to make sure that this is the &#147;next
step&#148; and not another casting assistant reaching out to schedule an original Zoom
interview. After a confirmation from the casting assistant saying that this was indeed the
&#147;next step&#148; I was told that a list of names was being sent to the network
producers for them to decide who is in and who is out.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Another week goes by, October 13<sup>th</sup>.
I get an email from an @priceisright.com email address asking me if I can schedule a quick
Zoom interview to actually test my knowledge about the show. This time there&#146;s no
pressure for me and I spend maybe 5 to 10 minutes talking with a member of the show&#146;s
actual casting team. She asks me several questions that I would consider basic knowledge
for anyone who would like to call themselves a Loyal Friend and True. I won&#146;t list
all of them, but some of the more basic ones included &#147;Name a model from a previous
decade&#148; &#147;What&#146;s the first item during Golden Road?&#148; or &#147;What does
37 hours represent?&#148; I get every single one of the questions correct and we chat
briefly about the show and what it means to me. I mention the fact that I picked my major
(Media Communications) because of the show and because I wanted to one day be the
executive producer of The Price is Right. She asks me who the EP is, and I answer with
Evelyn. She seemed a little impressed about that. One of the questions is about naming a
retired game and after that question I bring up Magic #. This is where all the rumors
about Magic # started back in mid-October. I had mentioned that I enjoyed the game and she
had said that it hasn&#146;t been played in studio for a while, leading to me speculating
whether or not it was retired. She said she wasn&#146;t involved with the lineup and games
part of the show, but she had noticed its disappearance as well. Overall, the entire
interview went really well, and she told me that while she couldn&#146;t confirm that I
would be selected for this episode, I would know if I would be invited to the studio no
later than the end of the next week.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">On the next Monday, October 17<sup>th</sup>,
I get a text message stating that while it&#146;s not a booking confirmation at that step,
I was still in consideration for the superfan special AND if I don&#146;t get selected for
that specific special, they will still reach out to me to get booked for a daytime
episode! So, no matter what happened after that point, I was going to be on The Price is
Right! Alright, while I might not have had a guaranteed spot in bidder&#146;s row,
I&#146;d like to think that they wouldn&#146;t have me fly out 3000 miles just so I get a
seat in the far back corner and never get to see myself on TV. I&#146;m asked to confirm
yet again that I&#146;m still available for the 9<sup>th</sup> of November, which I do,
and I&#146;m told that no later than the end of the week will I know if I&#146;m selected.
At this point in time, I begin watching the show a little more carefully, trying to find
trends between items, what do they repeat often enough, and what&#146;s most likely to
come up.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Thursday, October 20<sup>th</sup>, 2022.
2:31pm.&nbsp; I receive the email. The subject line says CONGRATULATIONS SUPERFAN! A
mixture of shock, nerves, and awe run through my body almost completely paralyzing me in
the moment. My Apple Watch warns me of an abnormally high heart rate. I begin to scream.
I&#146;ll admit I caused a bit of scene where I was, but after a few seconds people just
ignored me and carried on with their day. I get my booking letter telling me where to send
my vaccination card, what to bring and not bring, what to wear, what to avoid wearing, and
that I&#146;m allowed up to three guests. I quick send a message to a friend of mine
who&#146;s in the SoCal area and ask if she&#146;s interested in a Price taping, double
check with the casting producer that a shirt with retired game logos is ok and book a
flight out and a room at the SureStay across the street from TVC.</span></p>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">

<p>On November 3<sup>rd</sup>, I&#146;m asked to complete a form for setting up a COVID
test to be done the morning of, double check my phone number, and bring along any of my
Price memorabilia or pictures of it. I flex a little bit in my email back by namedropping
The National Archives of Game Show History at The Strong Museum of Play (they need a
shorter name, lol) in my email back as some of my Price collection is permanently &#147;on
loan&#148; to them. </span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">November 8<sup>th</sup>: I land at LAX and
head over to the hotel. I run over to a Target to grab some Gatorade and Skittles to
overdose myself on sugar the next morning and that combination usually gets my hyper at my
job. I&#146;m a roller coaster ride operator so being excited is part of my job
description. I&#146;m super jetlagged and tired after a near full day of flights, delays,
cancellations, rescheduling, and the hassles of renting a car. I ended up setting an alarm
for 6am, early enough to get breakfast and get a shower before my 8am call time, and
hopefully get over early enough to get number 001. I fall asleep at 9pm Pacific time,
unaware of what&#146;s about to unfold the next morning.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">6am Pacific time rolls around. My alarm
goes off, and the first thing I do is look at my phone. The unimaginable is the first
thing that pops up on my screen. It&#146;s an email and a text from the casting producer
telling me that due to a &#147;production issue&#148; they had to cancel the taping at the
11<sup>th</sup> hour, literally. The email and texts were sent out shortly before
midnight. I&#146;m sitting in bed, half awake, 100 feet from Television City, 3000 miles
from home, and I just burst out into tears. I&#146;m not an emotional person, but this was
my entire life&#146;s dream.&nbsp; I figure there&#146;s no use moping about and I quick
call my friend who was driving up from San Diego for the taping about the news and tell
her to turn around and head back home, get my shower, and head down to the hotel&#146;s
breakfast area. I threw one of my Price shirts on, not the one I made for the taping, but
a generic 30Years shirt. The first thing said to me as soon as I walk in the breakfast
area is &#147;You too?&#148; There were 4 or 5 people in the breakfast room who were
supposed to be at the taping. We talked a bit about the show, where we were from, and why
could they have possibly cancelled so late. The prevailing theory was that somebody really
important got COVID, probably Drew or George. <a href="http://www.golden-road.net/index.php/topic,33665.0.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unfortunately, we were proven right a few days
later.</a></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">I decide the best thing for me is to take a
walk around outside and clear my head. The sun is shining and it&#146;s a nice warm
morning in Los Angeles. I pass by the gate on Fairfax and while there&#146;s a few pages
around the gate, nobody from the show or anyone who looks like they were supposed to be on
the show were around. I keep going and decide to walk all the way around the facility. I
end up meeting a few more people who were supposed to be at the taping, two flight
attendants from Calgary, Canada. One of them was on the show a little over 10 years ago
and was in consideration for the redemption special but was asked if he&#146;d be
interested in the superfan special instead. We had ended up bumping into each other around
the secret back gate by The Grove where Rich Fields once snuck in and had remarked that it
was identical to how he described it and if we wanted, we could theoretically sneak in the
same way. We decided against it simply because we didn&#146;t want to get banned from TVC
before the taping.</span></p>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">

<p>I continue on my lap around TVC and end up seeing where the prize warehouses are
through the fence. I noticed they had 5 cars pulled out up front, each of ranging value. I
take pictures of them to make notes on them for later. I take I notice a few more people
with Price memorabilia on them as I finish up my walk and get pictures of the Bob Barker
mural and time capsule on the 36/46 building. By that point it was around 8:00 and so I
figure for the heck of it I&#146;ll walk down and see if anyone&#146;s there. I end up
talking with the head casting guy with the show who said that there&#146;s no chance of
them doing the taping for the next few days and they won&#146;t let anyone in even just to
see the studio. They were however talking with the executives from both the network and
Fremantle to see if our travel could be reimbursed and/or we get flown out for the
rescheduled taping.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">By this point I head back to me room a
little depressed but feeling better than I was in the morning and I go around doing some
touristy stuff like the Walk of Fame and Hollywood Sign, and I end up winning two free
tickets to see Wheel of Fortune Live which happened to be in town that night and <a href="https://buyavowel.boards.net/thread/17816/wheel-fortune-live-11-09" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I described how that experience went over at
BAV.</a></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">That evening I get a phone call from the
show that says while they unfortunately won&#146;t be able to reimburse me for my travel
expenses for this trip, they will fly me out and pay for my stay for the rescheduled
taping date, which will now be on November 29<sup>th</sup>. The casting director mentions
that this show was her baby, and she was twice as disappointed that we couldn&#146;t tape.
She mentions that unfortunately they would only cover my travel and not the travel of any
of my guests, but they would be trying their best to make it up to all of us.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">I finish out the rest of my stay in LA
making the most out of it, visiting touristy areas, spending a lot of time in The Grove
and Famer&#146;s Market, and overall, just trying to have a good time. I end up going to
the top of The Grove&#146;s parking structure only to find out that from that angle you
have an amazing view down into the prize storage area, and while you can&#146;t see
anything specific like what kind of a car they have out there, you can see a wide variety
of prizes. I noticed a trampoline or two, a 1950s style travel trailer, and some old prize
backdrops that haven&#146;t been used in a long, long while.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Not much happened in the 20 days between
the original taping and the rescheduled one. I had to fill out some forms, one specific
one being a W-9 for my travel reimbursement, and I also celebrated my 20<sup>th</sup>
birthday and Thanksgiving over the little break between tapings.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Monday, November 28<sup>th</sup>. I once
again land at LAX and instead of renting a car, Price has sent a car for me. After a quick
drive to the Short Stories hotel across the street from Television City, I check in and am
handed a swag bag from the show. With a nametag with my name on it attached to a special
50 Years tote bag containing 50 Years hat and a generic newer TPiR shirt I think I started
to tear up a bit in the lobby. That was the beginning of the experience officially
starting. The hotel was super nice and there were some prospective contestants mingling in
the lobby area. I decided to head right up to my room at settle in and take a nap ahead of
the early morning and long day coming up. After a quick nap I make a run to a Target not
that far from TVC to pick up an 8-pack of Gatorade and some sugary snacks to keep my
energy levels high in the morning. Overall, I probably get to sleep by 11pm or so.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">The next morning, everyone&#146;s down in
the lobby chatting about the show and having breakfast provided by the show at 7:45 am.
Breakfast wasn&#146;t much to write home about, just some bagels and danishes, but
I&#146;m not one to complain about free food. My guest, Marina, joined me at the hotel to
have a bite to eat before the taping.</span></p>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">

<p>At this point in the day, I visibly recognized maybe 5 or 6 people and talked with
probably 10 more. I could tell that the show was actually looking for real superfans, and
it was nothing like the 2018 superfan special. We were given quizzes about the show and
were truly dedicated people to come out to Los Angeles twice. A lot of us brought
memorabilia and pictures of the memorabilia they couldn&#146;t bring with them. I
specifically remember seeing the 2000s tabletop game and the Best Of DVD set, but I know
there were also autographed pictures of Bob Barker and DVD games and photos of so so so
much more Price memorabilia.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">At about 8:15 the contestant coordinators
called us out by name to make sure we were all present and walked us all across the street
to Television City. A quick security and ID check to get us in the building and we were
directed to a table where we were given a mask (if you didn&#146;t have one) a nametag,
and an order of arrival number. The process from this point onward is quite similar to the
original process as it&#146;s been for 50 years. I got OOA number 24 as there was a group
of 20 or so people who drove up and arrived at TVC for 8am flat. I was hoping to get
number 1, but I can take 24. The numbers have no bearing on where in the studio you sit
anymore nor have they for at least a decade, but it&#146;s still a pride thing to get 001.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">After being given our nametags and numbers,
a quick COVID test was administered. I ended up getting my COVID test taken twice because
the first time the person administering it was unable to get a large enough sample. Lucky
me. After the COVID test we were given contestant releases, a W-9, a social media release,
and various other paperwork to fill out. After filling out my paperwork I took a quick
stop at the Television City gift shop and bought some pins and a postcard. Little did I
know that wouldn&#146;t be the only piece of Price related merchandise I would receive
that day.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Once our paperwork was handed in, our
phones (and smartwatches) were taken away from us and we were placed on a second set of
benches to wait for our in-line interview. Despite everything else we&#146;ve had to go
through we were still given an in-line interview with Hannah, the casting producer. Marina
and I were joking a bit back in forth on the bench to pass the time, talking about big
wheel strategies and even trying to see if there was a way to sneak references from other
show moments into the show. (I wanna say hi to my friends Mike, Richard&#133;) Each
interview takes place is groups of 8 or so and being number 24 meant that I was the first
person in group three. In my head it felt like group one got about two minutes per
interview per person and group two got about one minute per interview per person. I
noticed some of the usual tells like &#147;What&#146;s your favorite game?&#148; and
&#147;Hope you enjoy the show!&#148; getting spread around during the interviews and hoped
for the best as my turn to speak began.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">As our group was called down to the
interview area, I ran on down while keeping the energy up, pumping my fists, and giving a
little woo. We were allowed to take off our masks for this small period of time, and after
a quick introduction of everyone, I was the first to go. I was shaking rather heavily and
very very nervous for the interview. I brought pictures my virtual set recreation and many
pictures of my Price memorabilia including the part of it that is currently in The
National Archives of Game Show History at the Strong Museum of Play. (They really do need
a shorter name) I remember being asked what my favorite game was, to which I went with
Race Game, not Ten Chances, because everyone else had already said Ten Chances and it felt
like a cliché at that point. Overall, the entire interview felt like it last maybe 30
seconds before she moved onto the next person in the group, which in my mind began setting
off alarm bells because I thought I blew it.</span></p>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">

<p>The rest of the group&#146;s interviews felt like they were about a minute and at that
point in time I thought that was it and I wouldn&#146;t be called down. After the group
finished, we were asked to go around the corner to another set of benches where an episode
of Price was playing (8172K) and the rest of the groups were. Before we had made it to
those benches however, a few of the superfans were separated from their guests and given
blue notecards with their name on them telling them what information Drew would be asking
about. There was also a little note saying, &#147;Don&#146;t mention any game strategies
on-air.&#148; I took it as a very good sign as I hadn&#146;t seen too many of those out,
so I stuck it in my bag right away and grabbed a snack at the snack table they had out for
us and enjoyed the show. I had mentioned the notecard to Marina and how I thought I blew
my shot in the interview and she said that it just felt fast to me, and I actually did
talk for a considerable amount of time. I had no clue at that point what was going to
happen. At this point I noticed at the end of all the benches parked next to the entrance
to Television City was Drew&#146;s multi-colored Mini Cooper and George&#146;s 1950s
convertible. This was really happening!</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">The superfans got to mingle a bit in line,
and I got to speak with Tris and a few others, talking about the blue cards and how many
of them there were, what they meant, all that. I got to meet a lot of great people,
including Melissa, from St. Louis and wrote into the show back in the 80s when she was a
kid for them to do a &#147;kids version&#148; of the show. She had a letter from Mark
Goodson productions saying that they&#146;d &#147;consider it&#148; and also an
autographed picture of Bob. We spend a few moments talking and then we
&#147;meditate&#148; a bit to calm nerves and just get into a fun mood. She had such a fun
positive vibe to her.</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">After the episode finished, a video of
George which was very obviously nearly a decade old at this point began to play, before
the pages quickly paused it to make an announcement. No food and drinks in the studio,
masks have to be worn until George tells you you&#146;re allowed to take them off, and if
you were given a blue card, please throw it out before you enter the studio. I had taken a
few notes about the episode they had played on my blue card (hence how I was able to tell
you it was 8172K) and really didn&#146;t want to throw it out, and I had a two spare
Gatorades in my bag, so I decided to chug a Gatorade and stick the spare in the bottom of
the bag with the blue card and not make a big deal out of it. If anyone noticed I would of
course throw them both out right away but with the Gatorade being sealed I really
didn&#146;t want to toss it.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">After the announcement from the pages, the
video was resumed with George giving a jokey monologue about the proper Price is Right
behavior featuring clips from 2009-2013 and a few very obviously edited in clips from
2013-2018. Perhaps it might be time to update that video again, guys? Once the video
finished, there was still another 10 minutes or so before the doors to the studio were
finally opened and the pages gave another announcement of make sure to throw out your food
and drinks and especially your blue card if you had one because you certainly won&#146;t
need one! The pushiness towards making sure that we all threw them out made me want to
keep mine and talk about it in this report. I probably would&#146;ve forgotten about it if
the pages didn&#146;t make a considerable number of announcements towards making sure they
were all discarded. Anyways I still have mine. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fi38_d0VIAArX4Z?format=jpg&amp;name=large" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here&#146;s a picture of it.</a></span></p>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">

<p>As we were entering the studio, we went up a flight of stairs to a mural of the TPiR
logo from 2003. I for whatever reason felt the need to pull my mask down and sniff it
while also run my hands up and down the wall to feel it. This while being highly strange,
is not the strangest thing I did that day. Once up the steps we passed by a sign with our
airdate (2/1/23) our episode number (54SP) a neon version of the CBS eye, and a replica
plaque dedicating the studio to Bob Barker. While peaking through the curtains I could
very clearly see the stage and I started to freak out a little bit. Once we walked through
the curtains into the studio properly, I just started looking around and taking in the
sights. Everything is a hell of a lot smaller than it looks. I&#146;ve known for years
that the place was small, but words cannot communicate just how actually tiny that place
truly is. There are two pages at the top of the aisle with a map of pods directing people
where to go. Once Marina and I get to the end of the line we say our names and how many
are in our group. We get ushered to Pod EE, which is located on the stage left side of the
center area. We had a great view of the stage and after setting our stuff down along the
backside of the pod we started clapping along with and dancing to the music they were
playing in the studio. A page came over and stressed the importance of that if either of
us got called down, to go to the aisle and walk down. Whatever you do, do not just go down
the steps in the center of the audience, walk out to the aisle and then walk down. Very
important.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Another ten or so minutes go by before the
generic hype music fades out and the S.Y.B. radio edit of Crystal Waters&#146; Come on
Down kicks into high gear and a disembodied voice comes over the PA system introducing
George Gray!!!1!11!!!!1!!!! The energy in the studio at that moment in time was absolutely
electric. I noticed that I wasn&#146;t the only one singing along to the words of Come on
Down and that&#146;s when it hit me. I was home. I finally made it. 20 years. Two trips to
LA. A lifetime of dedication to the show. And there I was. I didn&#146;t need to win any
prizes. I already won. I was there. Of course, I wanted to win prizes. I wanted to hear
George call my name. I wanted to shake Drew&#146;s hand. But at that very moment? I was
fulfilled. I&#146;ve heard the phrase &#147;religious experience&#148; be used in context
of what it&#146;s like to be at a taping of the show, and I didn&#146;t quite understand
what that meant, until then.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">George comes out and tells us that we can
rip off our masks, and we all do so and take a big deep breath. My blood is pumping. I
truly don&#146;t remember much about his warmup, mainly because I was already warmed up to
begin with. The fourth Gatorade was starting to hit my body, I was visibly shaking, and
that&#146;s when I notice it. There&#146;s a camera pointed directly at me. I try not to
look directly at it, but just glance at it from the corner of my vision. I discreetly try
to tell Marina about it, but mainly try and pay attention to George. For those not in the
know, before the show they will give the camera operators a map of who&#146;s getting
called down and where they&#146;re seated so they can get to the action every time. With
the camera being pointed directly at me, I take it as a very good sign and prepare myself
for the taping to begin.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">One last thing we&#146;re told, don&#146;t
stand up during the first four call downs, but once Drew comes out of the doors we can
stand. Fair enough. George runs behind his podium and quickly reads the slate. The Price
is Right at Night! Show number 54SP with an airdate of February 1<sup>st</sup> 2023!
There&#146;s a quick pause and then HERE IT COMES! George says the first four names, one
of them pops out from directly behind me, I try and go for a high-five, and then
immediately disappointment hits me because what if they weren&#146;t pointing the camera
at me but at him?</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">That disappointment quickly subsides
because OH MY GOD IT&#146;S DREW CAREY LIVE AND IN PERSON! The entire studio leaps to
their feet clapping and cheering, George says hi to Mamma Mai, and out comes the first
item up for bids! Everything is moving so fast I can&#146;t believe it. I shout out what I
think are some good bids on IUFB1, and when Drew reveals the ARP I react thinking that I
might have helped somehow. Drew walks up to the turntable and then everything stops. They
quickly put microphones on the three in Contestant&#146;s Row and on Caroline and have her
go back to the area by the steps to run towards Drew at Mach 1. She runs up and they open
up the door to reveal A BRAND NEW CAR!!!! One of the crew members holds up a cue card
saying the year, make, model, and trim of the car, but not any options, and shows it to
the entire audience before pointing it towards the contestant. As Money Game starts to
spin around the turntable, the entire audience all at once begins screaming EL CHEAPO!!!!
as loudly as possible, causing Drew to crack a bit of a smirk. Once Drew explains the game
and she begins looking out into the audience for help, everyone, and I do truly mean
everyone in the audience, begins screaming 05!! at her, which seemed to cause some
confusion, but she agreed with us and pulled 05 first. Of course, it was right. I, along
with a few other people in my area begin screaming 53 because we know not only was it El
Cheapo, but it was also front and back. Sadly, her group doesn&#146;t get that memo and
tells her to pick 74, which she does and is wrong. Thankfully she listened to the rest of
us on her second pick and she wins the car!</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">George calls down another name and we keep
going! Live-to-tape you know! The Race Game curtain is dropped, and they begin setting up
Act 2 during the IUFB. As soon as Cliff was revealed and while George was still describing
the trip to Switzerland the entire audience began shouting 20-30-40! simultaneously. When
Richard originally said $35 for the second prize there were some boos. Drew asked if it
was right, the buzzer sounded, and we were ready to see Hans ascend&#133; and then he
didn&#146;t. Drew asks for it again&#133; and he goes up without music! The audience still
claps along in-time with the music going through their head, and Drew starts to continue.
Over the PA we hear someone say &#147;hold, please&#148; and they have to reset the game
because the music didn&#146;t play. I guess they didn&#146;t rehearse it since they
thought it would be played perfectly. Drew and George start riffing a bit, eventually Drew
goes off on a tangent and starts singing some classic love songs. You have not been loved
until you&#146;ve been serenaded by Drew Carey. They get everything ready to go again,
Drew asks &#147;is it right?&#148; the buzzer sounds, and the game continues as normal.
Richard said $42 for the third item because &#147;he wasn&#146;t sure&#148; about it being
$40, which honestly is fair if it wasn&#146;t the superfan special. He wins the prize and
runs over to door three. Drew calls him back over and grabs the metal yodely guy off of
the game, autographs it, and gives it to him. I got to speak with him after the taping and
I can tell you that was a real yodely guy. That wasn&#146;t a cheap recreation they placed
as a prop. That was the real deal.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">We go into a little stopdown as they setup
the next act. Drew says that normally he&#146;ll go back to his dressing room between acts
but today he&#146;ll answer some audience questions. My hand shoots up first. He points
and me and I ask &#147;What happened to Magic #?&#148; He responds by saying &#147;They
still play it from time to time, they just don&#146;t like it as much. It&#146;s not like
the Credit Card game that we don&#146;t play anymore, but that&#146;s more of an Evelyn
question.&#148; Drew answers a few more questions, Rachel signs someone&#146;s DVD set,
Drew talks about Back to &#146;73, and we get the signal that we&#146;re good to start the
next act. George says another name, which is not me, and the show continues.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">The train comes out and scares the bejesus
out of everyone. It was really freakin&#146; cool to see in person. The fog machine was
super loud, and I probably jumped a smidge when it first appeared. There were some oohs
and aahs as it came out. Dean wins this IUFB and I am very happy that he did. We ended up
chatting with each other on the original tape date of November 9<sup>th</sup> by the rear
gate of Television City, he&#146;s the flight attendant from Calgary I mentioned earlier.
There were a lot of unscripted moments between George and Drew that didn&#146;t make it to
air from this segment. After Drew had mentioned that the dinner prize was at &#147;his
favorite restaurant&#148; George threw in a quick remark of &#147;Hope you like
Hardee&#146;s!&#148; which was rather funny. They bantered quite a lot and it&#146;s a
shame there&#146;s not enough time during the show to watch them go back and forth. While
George is describing the products, Tris (or someone from Tony&#146;s pod) shouts to Dean
to get two of the hot sauces, which he does and immediately wins with. One thing I found
interesting during this game is that while George was describing the products, the trip
screens changed from the prizes to a &#147;Secret X&#148; X, a Bullseye graphic, and the
matte for the grocery item wipe. After the descriptions were over they went back to being
the prizes. Perhaps some sort of technical limitations only allows them to have so many
computer graphics displayed on-screen at a time?</span></p>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">

<p>After Dean is done celebrating they quickly reshoot a few pickups, one of which being
the train with slightly less fog (I think this is the take that made it to air) and other
random things they needed to reshoot. Drew pops away into his dressing room at this point
and George takes a moment to explain to the superfans that &#147;after 50 years, the old
dog has found a new trick.&#148; I think it&#146;s been mentioned in other places across
the site and Discord, but I&#146;ll mention it here. The show is no longer done in order.
After the first three games, they play the next three games, and then both big wheels. It
saves time, it saves energy, and they only have to set the wheel up once. I hear a few
gasps from the audience, but once everyone closes their jaws Drew comes back out and
mentions that they now no longer need to send a stagehand back to retrieve Drew from his
dressing room, he has a vibrating pager like they have at fancy restaurants to alert him
now. George makes a comment along the lines of &#147;Do you wear it like that chess
player?&#148; and after a second and a half of everyone thinking about it, the studio
bursts into laughter. Drew says something like &#147;What I do in my time is my own
business.&#148; and someone (I know who, but I won&#146;t say who) in Contestant&#146;s
Row says, &#147;I have one in now.&#148; Such a fun little moment that would never make it
to a television screen ever.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size"><br>
We start back up and Theodora, come on down! By this point I was starting to get a little
worried, she was in the pod directly in front of me. Is it possible that I was just
imagining that the cameraperson was focused on me, and they were actually focused on
people around me? A million questions pop in my head but I don&#146;t have the time to
start doubting myself because out pops Alexis with a turntable package! I yell out some
decent numbers, somewhere in the $1,600 range, and Anitra gets lucky and pops up on stage.
While on stage Anitra mentions that she was named after Anitra Ford, one of the original
models, but unfortunately the name drop got cut from the broadcast. After that, I see the
cameras sweep the audience, so I turn around and see Rachel behind me. As CoG spins
around, the entire audience begins screaming GOING! as loud as possible, so loud in fact
that it made it into the final edit. It was such a fun moment, and I was genuinely
fulfilled by this point. I didn&#146;t even need to be called down; I was that proud.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">They have Drew record a quick pickup of
&#147;$11.98&#148; at this point. He first forgot the context and said it in a rather
solid tone, before being reminded it was for a win, and then shouted it out with
excitement. He went from 0-100 as soon as he said it and it caught me and a few others off
guard, generating some laughter and ruining a take. &#145;Twas a funny moment to see him
randomly shout &#147;$11.98!&#148; While that was going on, we could see them set up the
next game, which was seemingly Ten Chances. Nothing of the prop was shown but by what was
played already and by the staging it was the only game that made sense. Nothing could
prepare me for what was about to happen. Drew asks for another name and then I see it. My
name. On a cue card. I didn&#146;t hear George; you can&#146;t hear a thing in there. I
see my name and I leap to my feet. I was in pure shock. There&#146;s this phenomenon
called &#147;Third Man syndrome&#148; in which an unseen presence like a spirit will
provide support during traumatic experiences, and while being on Price isn&#146;t a
traumatic experience, I lost all control of myself. Genuinely I think the only reason I
made it down to contestant&#146;s row is a small voice in my head telling me &#147;You
need to walk over there now.&#148; And so I did.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">The designer accessories swing around the
turntable which generate an &#147;aw fudge&#148; from me, only I didn&#146;t say
&#147;fudge&#148; because I hate designer accessories with a passion. I barely hear the
description and from what I see there wasn&#146;t a lot involved with it. I look over to
Tony/Tris/Derek for help and I get a &#147;$2700&#148; to which I consider for a while. I
threw $38 at the end of it because I remember designer accessories seemingly ending in $19
for some reason, and I saw two pairs of objects over there. There&#146;s zero real logic
behind it but that&#146;s how I felt. Bidding goes around and Drew says &#147;$4-&#147;
and I immediately zone out. I look over at Joezen and I see him freaking out and he quick
runs up the stairs and then I process that I will be bidding 4th in the next round. And
then it processes that I&#146;ll be bidding 4th in the final round. I start getting in my
own head again, wishing that I would be able to win more than $300 and actually get to go
up on stage. But again before I can get too deep into thought, they open up the doors and
reveal a BRAND NEW CAR!! The first thing I noticed was just how small the Ten Chances
board actually is, watching it on TV makes the board look massive, but the entire prop is
actually rather small. I meme-shout a few 479s into my CRow mic hoping I&#146;ll survive
the edit and you can just about hear me as Drew&#146;s revealing the numbers for the
chairs. The entire game moves so fast because Joezen knew how to play, and I&#146;m
absolutely pumped up by this point.</span></p>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">

<p>While there wasn&#146;t a commercial on-air, there was a stopdown between games 5 and 6
so they could clear the stage and set up the next act. An audio person comes down at this
point and gives me a lavalier microphone and I walk over to the first pod on the stage
left side where Melissa is seated, and we &#147;meditate&#148; again for a bit because I
was absolutely off the charts, and I needed to be brought back down to reality if I wanted
to win anything. I was somewhat hoping that they&#146;d call her up next so that
she&#146;d win something, but I have no doubt she&#146;ll be back on the show soon. Drew
starts to interact with the audience again. He takes a few more audience questions and
then Stephanie gets Drew&#146;s attention and hands him a ticket to the 1960&#146;s Bill
Cullen show and asks him to sign it, he refuses to sign the ticket itself because it would
ruin the value and since nobody has a sharpie on hand, he sticks it in his pocket and
promises to sign the plastic casing after the show. We get all set up to start the next
act and what do you know, Stephanie is next to get called down!</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Out pops George running backwards on a
treadmill, and I immediately start pricing them in my head. I turn back to Tony/Tris/Derek
again to see what they say, and I hear an &#147;It&#146;s Bowflex so at least $3000!&#148;
and keep that in mind. Darry says $3050 and in my head I start debating if I really wanted
to do it or not. They cut quite a lot out but I spent probably a good 30 seconds of me
just apologizing to Darry for $1-upping him, but when else will I ever get the opportunity
to do that? Plus, he had plenty of chances to get up there before I got there. I say $3051
and Drew reveals the ARP. I hear Drew say the number and I process that I win but then I
immediately shut down and freeze. I don&#146;t know what to do, where to go, and at that
exact second I probably wouldn&#146;t even be able to tell you my name, even with it being
on my shirt. Drew says my name and that &#147;third man&#148; guide pops in my head again
telling me to walk up the steps and follow Drew. If only it was that easy. I trip going up
the steps, almost faceplant into the floor, and then to recover from it I kiss the daisy.
I don&#146;t notice it at this point but as I tripped I ended up slicing the inside of my
left arm rather badly leaving a decent six-inch gash down my forearm. I was so pumped up
on adrenaline I didn&#146;t even feel it, but it is somewhat visible if you know what to
look for. I go to stand up again, my legs are completely hollow, I am unable to stand up,
so I bend down and kiss the floor again. By that point I had enough blood in my legs that
I could push myself up, so I run over to Drew but as I go to walk I feel as if I was
wading through Jell-O. You can see it on the playback how I can&#146;t quite get over to
Drew without walking oddly. I say &#147;my legs stopped working&#148; because it genuinely
felt like they did. Drew asks me to explain why I&#146;m a superfan and I completely lose
every single thing about myself. I stammer a bit about watching The Barker Era channel and
a spreadsheet before apologizing for being so nervous and go to hug Drew. After I hugged
Drew I felt so much better and was ready to go back and actually explain what makes me a
superfan but he kept moving on with the game so I never got the chance to.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">George starts talking about the camper and
Now or Then spins around the turntable, as it spins around I give an O.K. hand signal to
Tony/Tris/Derek/Marina/JJ/Chad and a good ol&#146; fashioned shrug because I knew at that
point the camper was mine. The list of options just goes on and on and on and George keeps
describing it and I was expecting something like $15k or so, so when George says
&#147;$49,950&#148; I exclaim &#147;holy designer accessories!&#148; and while I am not a
swear-y person, there&#146;s something in that studio that just strips you down to your
most basic elements. The editors definitely had to work overtime to make me broadcast
presentable. As George describes the grocery items, what started as just Tony&#146;s pod
yelling &#147;NOW!&#148; quickly became the entire audience shouting a suggestion after
each description. You can hear it if you listen very closely at the end of every
description. After the fifth description George made a remark like &#147;or we can just
have the audience play the game!&#148; and I let out a good laugh at that. I start with
the seasoning because I knew that was most likely then, so getting a then product out of
the way early would be beneficial to me. I then move upward because I was very confident
in the dryer sheets and the cheese being now. When Drew asked me to guess on the other
products for shiggles, I originally wanted to go down to the Advil before he said
&#147;win first&#148; because I wasn&#146;t quite sure about the Advil being the second
&#147;then&#148; product. But he wanted me to win, so I said THE CHEESE IS NOW and the
rest is history. Drew&#146;s quick &#147;NOPE YOU&#146;RE WRONG&#148; about me screwing up
the beans and rice has lived in my head non-stop since it happened, and I think he got so
much joy out of that one moment because it was the first time someone actually screwed up
on something all day.</span></p>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">

<p>I win the camper and Drew says &#147;GO GET YOUR PRIZE!&#148; which then sends me
running at Alexis at full speed. Unfortunately I don&#146;t realize I&#146;m running at
her at full speed until a few seconds before I crash in to her, I see her eyes go wide and
recognize on her face that she&#146;s about to get hit, that&#146;s when I realize
I&#146;m running entirely too fast and will crash into her, I go to slow down but by that
point it&#146;s too late. I crash into Alexis and hug her a bit before running into the
camper. They had a teapot and a toilet brush in the camper for some reason, which was
visible on air during the prize description. For whatever reason, I grab the teapot and
the toilet brush and come out of the camper and just start waving them around! I notice
out of the corner of my eye one of the stagehands giving me one of the most disapproving
and confused looks I have ever received in my life, so I quick go back into the camper and
put the teapot and toilet brush down and the shot of me coming back out without either
item in my hand is what made it into the final edit. Drew walks over after he tosses to
break and congratulates me, I mention to Alexis that I loved her on Card Sharks and then I
mention to Drew that I actually saw the camper in the CBS parking lot the first time I was
out in LA two weeks prior. He congratulates me again and some stagehands wave me over off
the stage for the rules of the big wheel to be explained to me. At this point I hear
George talking to the crowd about them being the best audience they&#146;ve had since
COVID and the consolation prize of $300, and then the showcase showdown is explained to
all six of us playing. Nothing out of the ordinary, I&#146;m pretty sure all six of us
could&#146;ve explain the showcase showdown to the person explaining it to us in just as
much detail. We were told if we wanted to say hi to anyone to do it directly into camera
three. There&#146;s a red light on top of camera three and also two stagehands pointing
and flailing at camera three indicating where to look.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">I get escorted back to my pod and start to
freak out a bit with Marina and JJ being on both sides of me, and chat a bit with Chad and
JJ about the episode. The first showcase showdown goes by in a flash, and I&#146;m quickly
summoned back up to the stage for the second showcase showdown. They line us up and Joezen
and I talk a bit while Anitra spins. Joezen and I wish each other well when she stays with
an 85, and I get to watch Joezen spin the wheel. I wasn&#146;t aware that I was in the
shot at this point, so I was definitely mumbling to myself when he tied her. As I
approached the wheel I was overtaken by its inherent glitteryness. I have never seen such
a shinier object. I wind up the wheel for good luck and then start saying hi to everyone
on my pre-prepared and rehearsed list. My family, my &#147;online friends&#148; in
general, and then a specific shoutout to Wayo, 9821, and a few other people I consider
good friends. I got cut off at the last name by Drew pointing out the wheel was nearing a
dollar, and I apologized quite profusely to the one person who&#146;s name I didn&#146;t
get to say on national television after it aired. Once I landed on 80 I had a feeling my
time on the show was over, but I had to give it one more shot. I wind that sucker up one
more time, and I give it my all. I nearly fall over and without realizing just begin
chanting at the wheel like a Wheel of Fortune contestant in the 90s.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">After the wheel lands on 65 and the over
horn sounds, I&#146;m a little confused on where to go, but there were a few stagehands
over by the side of the turntable who motioned for me to walk over there, so I do. I get
to watch the rest of the showcase showdown from the stage, right along the side of the
turntable, next to a monitor. It was rather cool seeing the show both live and in person
in front of me, and also on the television screen right in front of me. When Joezen hit
the dollar the energy in the studio was absolutely electric. Price is one of those few
shows where everybody truly wants everyone to win. Yeah we&#146;d all like to win big
ourselves, but seeing other people win big is just as nice. After the showcase showdown is
over I&#146;m escorted back to my pod where I finally start to wind down after having the
fastest twenty minutes of my life. I talk a bit more with JJ and Chad about the show and I
finally realize there&#146;s a massive gash on my left arm. The showcases happen,
they&#146;re a bit of a blur, I just remember thinking &#147;Hey that&#146;s the first one
of those we&#146;ve seen in a decade!&#148; and &#147;There&#146;s no way it&#146;s a fur
coat&#133; is it a Vega??? Oh, it&#146;s just a car.&#148; during Showcase 2.</span></p>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">

<p>During the break between the showcases and the reveal a social media person comes over
to my pod and has me explain why I&#146;m a superfan and wanted me to talk all about the
shirt. I showed off all the games and mentioned Hit Me as my favorite mainly because it
was right next to Crane Game and I wanted to see if I could get that onto one of
Price&#146;s social media accounts in addition to the show itself. After the reveal they
bring out a big lottery style hopper with ping pong balls with numbers on it to draw a
winner of a $100 door prize for those who attended the show but didn&#146;t get called,
that prize ended up going to Joezen&#146;s husband, so not only did he win, so did his
husband. They were very lucky that day.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">As soon as the show ended they had the nine
of us who won brought down into a little green room which had the same vibe as the little
room from The Good Place where the people wake up in. There were bottles of water and
little cardboard holders for our nametags on chairs waiting for us. We were greeted and
congratulated many times over. There were some generic things that were told to all of us,
such as how we&#146;re responsible for a 7% CA state tax on all of our winnings and those
of us from out of state (which I think was all of us except Joezen) were required to pay
those within 30 days of the airdate and how we weren&#146;t allowed to tell anyone we were
on the show until it aired and the only thing we were allowed to say was we &#147;attended
a taping of The Price is Right and had a fabulous time.&#148; The show does not provide
copies of episodes to contestants so you should DVR it or tape it, if you can&#146;t
it&#146;s on CBS.com, available on-demand through most cable providers, and streaming on
Paramount +. The prize coordinator also mentioned that &#147;some guy will inevitably
upload it to YouTube&#148; to which I wanted to respond with &#147;I&#146;m that
guy!&#148; before realizing that maybe outing myself wouldn&#146;t be the best idea. Since
paperwork is processed from lowest winnings to highest, I ended up being one of the last
ones in the green room and I got to overhear many different things that contestants were
being told one-on-one with the prize coordinators, <a href="http://www.golden-road.net/index.php/topic,33873.0.html" class="bbc_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which I mentioned in this thread earlier.</a></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 1em;" class="bbc_size">Once our paperwork was finished we were
given our cue cards with our names on them and asked if we were willing to stay and go
back into the studio to tape a few promos for The Barker Era streaming channel. All of us
happily agreed to do so and were escorted up in groups. The contestants for the second
taping were waiting out on the benches to enter the studio so they had us sequestered from
everyone else so that we wouldn&#146;t spoil anything. Dean, Richard, and Anitra were
escorted up first and then after they were finished, Joezen, Caroline, and I were escorted
up into the studio, through a passageway behind the audience and along the side of the
stage, past the production table and where the mighty sound effects lady is located,
through a small hallway, past Drew&#146;s private dressing room, out into the main
corridor of Television City and around a corner to where the turntable games are stored. I
noticed a whiteboard with partially filled in lineups for 0094L, 0095L, and 0101L on a
wall, and was absolutely thrilled to be in the warehouse. There were a lot of things
recognizable from previous shows, art cards saying CLIFF SURFERS and ONE RIGHTOUS PRICE,
the mannequins from April Fools the one year, the windmill used in Hole in One during Big
Money Week, and even the range finder used during The New Price is Right 1994&#146;s
pilots. The entire time I spent up there was absolutely insane as every place I looked I
recognized something else. By the time all three of us are done taping, lunch is over and
rehearsal for the second taping is starting, so they can&#146;t escort us back out through
the studio, so we go out through the main corridor, passing Pay The Rent and Punch-A-Bunch
in the hallway, along with other various cars and things, before descending down an
elevator and through a rather long hallway decorated with poster from various Television
City productions such as All in the Family and Cher before finally exiting the building
through the Carol Burnett Artist&#146;s Entrance. There&#146;s another group of people
seated by the gift shop filling out forms and we&#146;re told to not make a big scene
about it to not spoil the show and then finally I am reunited with Marina after an hour
and given my phone and smartwatch back.</span><br>

Floor&#148; because there was speculation on the color of the floor as word had gotten out
that they were changing the color of the floor and updating the big wheel carpet and
people were curious about that on the site. &#147;Fabulous time&#148; being code for
&#147;I was called down&#148; without flat out saying it. It&#146;s what you&#146;re
allowed to tell people, and so in the nine weeks between taping and airing, I probably
said the phrase &#147;I attended a taping of The Price is Right and had a fabulous
time&#148; a solid two to three thousand times.</span><br>

thing. From start to finish. Please ask questions, I know I&#146;ve forgotten things and
skimmed over things, if you have a question please ask it and I will answer it to the best
